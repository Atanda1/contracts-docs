# Paycrest

The P2P powered crypto-to-cash protocol.

Paycrest contracts are multi-chain EVM-based smart contracts that facilitate the on-chain lifecycle of a payment order. They empower a sender to create a payment order, while enabling a liquidity provider to facilitate that order at a good exchange rate.

## Overview

Welcome to Paycrest Documentation. You'll find comprehensive guides and documentation to help you start working with Transak as quickly as possible, as well as support if you get stuck. Let's jump right in!

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

The `yarn start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/index.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
