# Paycrest Documentation

Decentralized payment infrastructure for people and businesses.


Paycrest contracts are multi-chain EVM-based smart contracts that facilitate the on-chain lifecycle of a payment order. They empower a sender to create a payment order, enable a liquidity provider to receive cryptocurrency in escrow, and much more.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn start
```

The `yarn start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/index.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
